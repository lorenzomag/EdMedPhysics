   and create plots to visualise the data

   This program was written for the EdMedPhysics 
   projects in 2021 to assist with data analysis.
   
   Input:
   A root file which is the output from
   the Geant4 simulation.
   
   Output: 
   1) an output root file containing new histograms
   2) pdfs of the histograms
   
   How to run:
   
   From terminal command line
   $ root make_histos.C

   From the root prompt
   $ root
   [0] .x make_histos.C
